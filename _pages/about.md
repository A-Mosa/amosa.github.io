I am a Lecturer in Computer Science Education at the University of Strathclyde.Received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Manchester in 2019, titled “Virtual Machine Consolidation in Cloud Data Centres using a Parameter-based Placement Strategy”. I have experience in designing, developing and delivering innovative computer science curricula and assessments. In addition, I have an extensive teaching experience in programming languages (such as Java, Python, JavaScript and PHP), cross-platform mobile and web development, computer networks, cyber security, databases, big data analytics, distributed systems and cloud computing. Currently, I am leading two modules at the University of Strathclyde: Cross-Platform Mobile App Development and Full Stack Web Development.

My research expertise is in the autonomic provisioning and management of cloud and edge infrastructures. Besides, the scalability of containerized applications (such as big data platforms) in the cloud using reactive and proactive approaches. My research interests include:

    - Resource management in Cloud and Edge
    - Auto-scaling and deployment of containerized applications in the Cloud
    - Scheduling algorithms in distributed systems
    - Scalable big data infrastructures
    - Machine learning for proactive resource management and provisioning
